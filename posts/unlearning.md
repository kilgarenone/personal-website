My last post was about unlearning the gospel of 'efficiency' while remaining 'civilized'. And this post is about unlearning even the 'civilized' part.

Human activities in recent decades has massively [disrupted](https://guymcpherson.com/climate-chaos/climate-change-summary-and-update/) the earth's life-supporting systems which had allowed all forms of life-including human- to evolve. Everything existed in perfect harmony within natural constraints- until the invention of technology particularly agriculture which has led to the cycle of boom and bust of human civilizations.

From reading a book called 'The Short History of Progress', I learned that all ancient great empires and civilizations collapsed under the weight of their own ingenuity, intractable complexity, desolated environment, moral decay, and warring social classes. This predicament drove colonization to new territories, and history repeats again.

Then we have Capitalism. The development of Capitalism led to the monetization of all life on earth, treating nature as 'resources' to be exploited and traded for human's interest. It led to the 'Enlightenment', 'rationality', 'scientific methods', which led to the mechanization of nature and human body in a reductionistic manner by which we can break and study in pieces in order to bend to our will.

Such hubris is obvious in the rise of green energy, green technology, and green economic policies. We haven't realized that it was our sheer arrogance with respect to nature that got us in this predicament. We still believe we can invent and deploy new technologies to fix things in order to perpetuate our current destructive social-economic paradigm that is all about infinite growth. But infinite growth is impossible in a finite world. Building solar panels at scale is not possible without burning even more fossil fuels, hence accelerate us to the ground off the cliff.

> Even if people sense that something is not quite right - civilization has gotten too big, too complex, too hard to manage- they may still not see that the problems are caused in large part by exponential growth, not in programs or technologies designed to allow it to continue. For if you remove one constraint, renewed growth quickly pushes the civilization up against the next one, and so on, until it buckles under the strain.

It didn't used to be this way.

A book called ['Ancient futures'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Futures) shows the lives of the Ladahk folks being turned upside down by the introduction of capitalism and its accompanied proselytizing of 'modern development'. Flourishing intricate relationship between the people and environment and animals that had been cultivated for thoudsands of years were deemed 'backward' and inefficient from the ethnocentric lens of Western culture. The results were many folds and familiar- the destruction of environment, population increase, air pollutions, disintegrating of support network between families, youth moving to urban leaving behind elders fending for themselves, uptick of psychological illness and identity crisis.

The Ladahk people didn't need western cultures and its toxic auxiliary baggage. Until the onset of 'development', they were happier and well-balanced physically and psychologically than people in developed countries will ever be. They didn't need to purposely read 'self-help' books or watch TED talks like we do. They were respectful to all beings around them. They knew the limits and not to cross them. They already practised ['precautionary principle'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle) without having to learn about it. Because as a follower of Buddhism, they realized-as did by other indigenious people- everything is interconnected. They didn't need science and opaque rationality to realize that as we have.

Was this all inevitable? Perhaps any intelligent being like homo-sapiens always end up in ruins and extinction. Perhaps that's the answer to the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox).

I would like to think our predicament couldn't have been attributed to malice. But reading ['Caliban and the Witch'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliban_and_the_Witch) tells me there was a long history of struggles between, on one hand, mercantilist, Church, noble class, and on the other, the poor, peasants, vagabond, slaves, and woman. Needless to say, the former group prevailed.

Is it too late to imagine an alternative outcome? Alternative to capitalism?(not socialism which is just another way to exploit and distribute resources).

Well, we know we are going to have an ice-free arctic in the near-term with so much of heat already baked in the system(Read ['The End of Ice'](https://www.dahrjamail.net/the-end-of-ice/)). And when that happens, all hell breaks loose due to the complexity and interconnectedness of all earth's systems on which all life depend.

But 'action is the antidote to despair'. We can take right action and not be attached to the outcome. Or do nothing of that sorts. Rather, tend to incomplete relationships and love the few people close to us with whatever time we all have left. And just dance and play, for indeed, this miraculous 'life is short'.

So, there is quite a handful to unlearn here. I had until recently built my entire life, body and mind on the pillars and trends of western civilizations- I fancied myself with entrepreneurship; I hustled; I hacked my life, my diets; I dealt with my depression alone; I learn everything I could about the universe; I strived to be rational and skeptical but ended up a cynic that's just all talks; I was a dissapointed idealist; I behaved and acted the 'right' and 'moral' ways; I strive to have the higher moral ground; I awaited Singularity to save us all; I learnt all the types of cognitive biases; I looked up to western iconoclasts; I read their books; I self-taught programming for one year because I wanted to be one of the success stories; I worked cheaply and long hours for local tech startups; Back home, I continued learning so I can help them reach IPO sooner...; I only worked in tech startups to hit the jackpot; I quit them all the time; The salary increments stroke my ego and reinforce my high identity; only for a while, it was never enough.

What a pile of fucking shits.

Dance. Play. Love. You. Me. Us. Now. Here.

That's it. And that's enough.
